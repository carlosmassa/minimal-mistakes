# Indicator Overview 

The 2-Year MA Multiplier is intended to be used as a long term investment tool.

It highlights periods where buying or selling Bitcoin during those times would have produced outsized returns.

To do this, it uses a moving average (MA) line, the 2yr MA, and also a multiplication of that moving average line, 2yr MA x5.

Note: the x5 multiplication is of the price values of the 2yr moving average, not of its time period.

Buying Bitcoin when price drops below the 2yr MA (green line) has historically generated outsized returns. Selling Bitcoin when price goes above the 2yr MA x 5 (red line) has been historically effective for taking profit.

# Why This Happens

As Bitcoin is adopted, it moves through market cycles. These are created by periods where market participants are over-excited causing the price to over-extend, and periods where they are overly pessimistic where the price over-contracts. Identifying and understanding these periods can be beneficial to the long term investor.

This tool is a simple and effective way to highlight those periods.
